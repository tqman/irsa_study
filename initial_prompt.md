I'd like to make a browser-based app that will allow me to practice the International Radiotelephany Spelling Alphabet. I'd like these features:

1. It should randomly choose a letter and display it.
2. It will listen on the microphone for me to say a word. If I don't answer within a configurable amount of time, it will display the correct answer.
3. If I answer with the wrong word, it will give me the correct answer.
4. If I answer correctly, it should give me positive feedback
5. It should advance to the next card when I hit space.
6. I should be able to host this on GitHub Pages and it should have zero operating cost.
7. Use the browser's built-in Web Speech API for speech recognition (no external services).
